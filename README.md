 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Piotr1011

- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in No-code and Low-code software development and software testing (manually and automatically - Selenium IDE).  I create mainly in MS Access due to low programming skills in languages other than vba or SQL, and also in RadBuilder (Longtion) without using code. I am also interested in geostatistical analysis and work with QGIS software. The programs I create are mainly related to performance reporting from the distribution and warehouse logistics area, due to my background and passion for finding solutions to optimize and support the work of supply chain people. 

- ðŸŒ± I'm a self-taught developer. For my fun in creating programs I learned the basics: pascal, vba, sql, pl/sql, javascript.

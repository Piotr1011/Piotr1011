 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Piotr1011

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in software development based on relational databases, software testing (manually and automatically - Selenium IDE). The programs I create are mainly used to report the results of the distribution and warehouse logistics area, due to my education and passion for finding solutions to optimize and support the work of people in the supply chain area. I mainly create in MS Access because of my low skills in programming in languages other than vba and also in RadBuilder (Longtion) without using code. 
I am also interested in geostatistical analysis and work a with QGIS program.

- ðŸŒ± I'm a self-taught developer. For my fun in creating programs I learned the basics: vba, sql, pl/sql, javascript.
